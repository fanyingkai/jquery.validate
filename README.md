jquery.validate
=============

A simpler, more elegant form validation plugin.

I wrote this plugin for a specific project I was working on. I needed a very simple form validator and wanted one that actually looked good. Plus I wanted to use HTML5's built-in attributes for marking up validation requirements.

This only supports the specific use-cases that I needed, but I plan on completing more when I have time. You're welcome to make contributions as well.
